// Q.3 (15 points) Implement the class myLock to coordinate entry 
// into a room by various threads. There are two types of threads 
// in the system - type1 and type2. The only requirement is that 
// there should not be two threads of different types in the room 
// at any time. Implement the class myLock with three methods void 
// request1(), void request2() and release(). Threads of type 1 use 
// request1() and threads of type 2 use request2() to enter the room. 
// All threads use release() to exit the room. You do not have to 
// worry about starvation.

public class MyLock {

    public void request1() {
        // TODO
    }

    public void request2() {
        // TODO
    }

    public void release() {
        // TODO
    }
}
